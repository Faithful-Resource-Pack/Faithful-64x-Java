## How to download:
The latest release versions can be downloaded on [our website](https://faithfulpack.net/faithful32x/latest) and the latest unreleased versions on [our database](https://database.faithfulpack.net/packs/32x-Java/Experimental/).

## How to switch versions:
To view the pack files and to switch between resource pack versions, click the branch button (`main`) and select the version you want to see! 

If you want to play on snapshots or pre-releases, the `java-latest` branch contains textures that aren't in numbered versions yet.
